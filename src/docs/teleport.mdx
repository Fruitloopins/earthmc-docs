# Teleport
EarthMC does **not** support player to player teleportation.

You are able to teleport to your own town, your nation capital and capitals of allied nations.

`/t spawn`

`/n spawn`

`/n spawn alliednationname`

This system ensures that the nation capital becomes a centerpoint in the nation just the way capitals are in real life. The capital will turn in to a trade hub since nation residents and residents of allied nations have direct access. This system also allow nation kings to engage in trade wars as they're able to restrict their nation residents from accessing enemy nations' markets. 

New players are not able to teleport until they join a town/nation.
